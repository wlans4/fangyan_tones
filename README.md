Repo for the study of tonal composition of chinese music, specifically rap


To setup the project, run 
```pip install .``` or ``` pip install -e .``` for an editable version

You should then be able to run main.py in scripts to pass in chinese text

After passing in the song lyrics, by inputting "Analyze" you can output the Tone table for the line endings.
